# Acquia Content Hub Console
Acquia Cloud Content Hub Console provides a command line tool to execute Acquia Content Hub related commands on all sites that belong to a 
particular platform, like
  - Acquia Cloud
  - Acquia Cloud - Multisite
  - Acquia Site Factory 

One of the most important commands that is provided by this tool is the one that allows you to upgrade your sites from
Content Hub 1.x to 2.x by executing a single command and performing all the operations that are required by the upgrade. 

# Installation
Install the package with the latest version of composer:

    $composer require acquia/contenthub-console
    $composer install

Note that this package must be installed locally and in the codebase on your remote platform (Acquia Cloud or Acquia 
Site Factory) in order for commands to work.

# Create a Platform

In order for this tool to execute commands remotely on your Acquia Cloud Platform, first create a platform with the 
following command:

    $./vendor/bin/commoncli pc
    
This command will guide you through the platform creation. Notice that the alias given to this platform will be what you 
will use later when executing commands remotely.
